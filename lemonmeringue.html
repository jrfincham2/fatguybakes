<div class="method">
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Pastry:<br>Pulse the ingredients in a food processor until they reach a bread crumb consistency.<br>
    Add cold water a little at a time until the pastry begins the come together.<br>
    Tip out the pastry onto a sheet of clingfilm, wrap and press together.<br> 
    Gently press into a disk shape and chill, at least an hour, preferably overnight.<br>
    When ready to bake, roll out into a tin and blind bake at 180C<br><br></p>
    <p>Filling:<br>Whisk sugar, zest and cornflour into the juice over a low heat, whisking constantly.<br>
    When it begins to thicken remove from heat add the butter and stir in until melted.<br>
    Beat the eggs and temper with some of the warm curd. Add to the pan and gently heat again.<br>
    Keep stirring or whisking until the eggs cook and the curd begins to go very thick.<br>
    Pour into cooked pastry case and allow to cool fully before adding the meringue.<br><br></p>
    <p>Meringue:<br>Whisk the egg white until they reach soft peaks.<br>Mix the sugar and cornflour then add to the eggs.<br>
    Go slowly, about a tablespoon at a time to make sure the sugar gets fully incorporated into the meringue.<br>
    Top the cooled tart, try and get it right to the edges to properly seal over the pastry<br>
    Bake at 140c for 1hr - 1 1/2 hours until there's a thick crust on the meringue. Keep going if you like it darker</p>
