        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>Pastry:<br>Pulse the ingredients in a food processor until they reach a bread crumb consistency.<br>
            Add cold water a little at a time until the pastry begins the come together.<br>
            Tip out the pastry onto a sheet of clingfilm, wrap and press together.<br> 
            Gently press into a disk shape and chill, at least an hour, preferably overnight.<br>
            When ready to start roll out and line a deep flan tin. Chill again until custard is ready.
            <br><br></p>
            <p>Filling:<br>Whisk together the cream and cornflour, adding in the eggs one at a time.<br>
                Whisk together the milk, vanilla and sugar and gradually bring to the boil, stirring constantly.<br>
                When the milk is boiling remove from the heat and temper into the cream mixture.<br>
                When fuly tempered, add back into the pan and heat back up being careful to scrape the side and bottom to prevent burning.<br>
                Once the custard has thickened pour into the pastry and bake in a preheated 200c oven for about an hour.<br>
                Once the top is thoroughly blackened remove from oven and cool for several hours or overnight to allow the custard to set <br><br></p>
